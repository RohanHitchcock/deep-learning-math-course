# The Mathematical Engineering of Deep Learning
 
This repository contains selected programs written by me when I was completing 
the course [*The Mathematical Engineering of Deep Learning*](https://deeplearningmath.org)
as part of the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute Summer School in 
February 2021. It should be viewed as a portfolio of selected work, rather than 
a repository of code ready for use.

### Contents:
- `project`: contains the final project for the course. Please read `project/report.pdf`
or `project/proposal.pdf` to get an understanding of the task.
- `neural_network.py`: contains an 'from scratch' implementation of a fully connected 
neural network class.
- `optimisers.py`: implements several optimisers.
